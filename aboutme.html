    <h1>About me</h1>
    <p>1: I am working on working harder towards football and my basketball career. My experiences that have led me to want to pursue is when I scored my first shot and my first touchdown of my high school career.  

2: I am working on these goals by putting the work in on the court and on the field. I am also working on these goals by working out in the weight room everyday, and practicing my skills everyday after school.

3: I value these as my most necessary because strength and cardio is what you need to either play basketball or football. I value these because they make me stronger and not as tired while playing. 

4: My short term goals are to pass my high school year and start as a wide receiver and get more touchdowns and to also start on next years basketball team. Also 

5: I mostly want to be known for my caring and my funny side of myself because I love to make people laugh and make sure they are okay and having fun. I also want to be known as the kid people can come to and that will be there for them.</p>
